        "# The Efficacy of Reasoning in AI Models\n",
        "This notebook is designed to investigate the following research questions:\n",
        "1. Do all tasks benefit from reasoning?\n",
        "2. Do different models show varying benefits from reasoning?\n",
        "3. Do different reasoning approaches (e.g., Chain of Thought, Program of Thought) yield different benefits?\n",
        "4. Is there a task-approach fit? Do certain tasks benefit more from specific reasoning methods?\n",
        "5. What is the cost-benefit tradeoff for each approach and task?\n",
        "6. Can we predict the need for reasoning based on the input prompt alone?\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to Use This Notebook:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Setup**: Run the first code cell to install necessary libraries and enter your API keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Configuration**: Use the interactive widgets in the \"Experiment Configuration\" section to select the provider, model, hyperparameters, and reasoning approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data**: The notebook loads a placeholder dataset. Replace it with your actual Hugging Face dataset and perform any other preprocessing/concatenation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pipeline**: Run the \"inference\" cell to setup the pipeline. No changes required.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Execution**: Run the \"Execute Experiment\" cell to start the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Results**: The results will be collected and displayed in a table, which you can then download as a CSV file."

The color of the items was respectively as follows: the first 3 were beige, the next 5 were black, the next 1 was brown, the next 1 was crimson, the next 3 were cyan, the next 2 were gray, the next 1 was green, the next 1 was indigo, the next 1 was ivory, the next 5 were khaki, the next 1 was orange, the next 2 were pink, the next 1 was purple, the next 1 was red, the next 3 were silver, the next 2 were teal, the next 3 were turquoise, the next 1 was violet. Then, my brother replaced any item of size extra-extra-small in my collection with an exact copy but with one specific size (different from extra-extra-small) and another exact copy but with color crimson. After this, my collection had: 6 extra-large item(s), 8 small item(s), 7 extra-extra-large item(s), 2 extra-small item(s), 4 medium item(s), 10 large item(s), 7 extra-extra-small item(s). Then, my friend took any item with a smell of wet dog, coconut or chocolate in my new collection and threw it away. Then, my uncle threw away any Iranian item in my new collection, but gave me two of the same item, one French and one Italian (all other properties the same). Then, for any item with a smell of popcorn, leather, or chocolate in my new collection, my cousin gifted me another one of that item with the same properties but with her favorite smell (different from the three smells above). After this, my new collection had: 6 item(s) with garlic smell, 1 item(s) with gasoline smell, 2 item(s) with popcorn smell, 5 item(s) with vinegar smell, 4 item(s) with lavender smell, 3 item(s) with coffee smell, 4 item(s) with vanilla smell, 1 item(s) with leather smell, 2 item(s) with freshly cut grass smell, 1 item(s) with pine needles smell, 2 item(s) with baking bread smell, 1 item(s) with citrus fruits smell. Then, my fiance compared my new collection with my initial collection and if there was an item in my new collection with a (smell, color) pair that was different from the (smell, color) pair of all items in my initial collection, she added another copy of that to my new collection.  Then, I lost one of the extra-large items in my collection.  In my current collection, how many items have the following attributes: either color is ivory, or size is extra-large, or material is glass, or smell is popcorn, or origin is Russian?

Then, if I had an even number of an item type in my collection (e.g. two knives, regardless of their size, color, origin, material, or smell), I threw all of them away. Then, for any item made of glass in my new collection, my sister changed their color to her favorite color and changed their smell to rose.

In addition to the 2 red items mentioned above, there is the extra-extra-small British shoe (popcorn smell), extra-large French ruler (vinegar smell), medium Iranian screwdriver (wet dog smell), large Mexican fork (vinegar smell), large Iranian brush (rose smell), and large French candle (chocolate smell).\\u00a0\\n\\n- Smell: Pine Needles - 4 items\\n\\nThe items that smell like pine needles include the extra-extra-small Portuguese ball (plastic, blue), extra-large Polish pen (concrete), one of the large items replaced by your brother (which we'll call 'replaced large item 1' - this was kept as the same size large), and the extra-large Turkish umbrella.\\u00a0\\n\\n- Origin: Russian - 2 items\\n\\nThe 2 Russian items in your collection are the extra-extra-large lamp, made of plastic and smelling of coffee, and the aforementioned extra-large bottle, which is glass and has a smell of baking bread.\\u00a0\\n\\nTherefore, the total number of items that possess at least one of these attributes is the sum of the above groups, which gives us 2 + 5 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 21 items.\\u00a0\\n\\nHowever, there are overlaps in the attributes. The extra-large Russian bottle and the extra-extra-large Turkish key are both red in color and have a vanilla smell, so these count towards both the 'color is red' and 'smell is pine needles' categories. Similarly, the extra-large Turkish umbrella appears in both the 'smell of pine needles' and 'origin is Russian'\",\n          \"## Final Answer using the Spreadsheet Wonder Approach:\\n\\nWe'll use a spreadsheet to neatly organize and manipulate the data for the best clarity and efficiency. \\n\\n### Step 1: Initial Collection\\n\\nWe start with 33 items, each with multiple attributes.

The color of the items was respectively as follows: the first 2 were beige, the next 2 were black, the next 1 was blue, the next 3 were brown, the next 1 was crimson, the next 1 was cyan, the next 1 was gold, the next 1 was gray, the next 3 were green, the next 1 was indigo, the next 1 was magenta, the next 4 were maroon, the next 5 were orange, the next 2 were purple, the next 2 were red, the next 2 were silver, the next 2 were teal, the next 1 was turquoise, the next 2 were violet, the next 2 were white, the next 3 were yellow. Then, for each item of size large in my collection, my aunt took it but then gave me another one of the same item made of her favorite material and with a smell of pine needles (all other properties the same). After this, my collection had: 6 item(s) made of concrete, 8 item(s) made of glass, 16 item(s) made of plastic, 7 item(s) made of ceramic, 5 item(s) made of steel. Then, my brother replaced any item of size large in my new collection with an exact copy but with one specific size (different from large) and another exact copy but with color maroon.

This will offer a clearer visual overview, making it easier to tally the relevant items. From there, sum up the respective counts for each attribute you mentioned (red color, small size, steel material, pine needles smell, Russian origin). If the total count of items fulfilling any of these conditions turns out to be the same as the initial collection count (before changes were made), then the final answer would be 38 items.\\n\\n**Approach 2: Systematic Item Analysis**\\n\\nMethodically work through each item's attributes as outlined in the problem, breaking them down into distinct categories: size, material, color, smell, and origin. Determine the count of items fulfilling each condition one by one, adding up the counts for each respective category. For instance, identify the number of items that are red, then the number of small items, and so forth. Finally, add these counts together, ensuring that each item is only counted once. If certain attributes are mutually exclusive, such as size and material, then ensure that their counts are accurately reflected without overlap. Conclude with a final tally of items that fit the specified criteria. If the computation matches the initial collection size, the answer would be 38.\\n\\n**Approach 3: Collection Comparison**\\n\\nExamine the changes made to the collection after each intervention, paying close attention to the items added or removed during each stage. Start with the initial collection of 42 items and note the alterations made by your aunt, brother, sister, and so on. At each stage, determine the number of items matching the specified attributes and cross-reference that with the prior stages to deduce the final count. This approach involves meticulous tracking of the changes, ensuring that each addition or subtraction is considered. The final count of items with the mentioned attributes will resolve to either a specific number or \\\"unknown.\\\"\\n\\nThese approaches may serve as a foundation for solving the problem, but further insights and calculations are required to reach the final answer.

Starting with the initial collection and incrementally adding up items as per the conditions could lead to mistakes or misunderstandings, especially since some changes involve replacing items while others add new ones. \\n\\nApproach 2, however, takes a simplistic approach by categorizing the items based on the given attributes in a sequential manner. Size, material, color, smell, and origin are distinct categories that can be analyzed individually, ensuring a clear count for each. Additionally, this method doesn't require intricate cross-referencing or a complex understanding of the changes over time.

These are the extra-extra-large Turkish key and the extra-large Russian bottle, both smelling of vanilla and made of steel and glass respectively.\\u00a0\\n\\n- Size: Small - 5 items\\n\\nThere are 5 items of small size in the collection. These include the British canvas (burning wood smell, plastic material), small Turkish scissors (ceramic, coffee smell), small Polish book (baking bread smell, steel), extra-extra-small Polish umbrella (glass, vanilla smell), and the small Canadian trash can (plastic, leather smell).\\u00a0\\n\\n- Material: Steel - 8 items\\n\\nThere are 8 items made of steel in total. In addition to the 2 red items mentioned above, there is the extra-extra-small British shoe (popcorn smell), extra-large French ruler (vinegar smell), medium Iranian screwdriver (wet dog smell), large Mexican fork (vinegar smell), large Iranian brush (rose smell), and large French candle (chocolate smell).\\u00a0\\n\\n- Smell: Pine Needles - 4 items\\n\\nThe items that smell like pine needles include the extra-extra-small Portuguese ball (plastic, blue), extra-large Polish pen (concrete), one of the large items replaced by your brother (which we'll call 'replaced large item 1' - this was kept as the same size large), and the extra-large Turkish umbrella.\\u00a0\\n\\n- Origin: Russian - 2 items\\n\\nThe 2 Russian items in your collection are the extra-extra-large lamp, made of plastic and smelling of coffee, and the aforementioned extra-large bottle, which is glass and has a smell of baking bread.\\u00a0\\n\\nTherefore, the total number of items that possess at least one of these attributes is the sum of the above groups, which gives us 2 + 5 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 21 items.\\u00a0\\n\\nHowever, there are overlaps in the attributes. The extra-large Russian bottle and the extra-extra-large Turkish key are both red in color and have a vanilla smell, so these count towards both the 'color is red' and 'smell is pine needles' categories. Similarly, the extra-large Turkish umbrella appears in both the 'smell of pine needles' and 'origin is Russian'\\n\\n\",\n          \"----------\\nPROMPT:\\nFor the question 'I had a collection of 33 weird items that went through a few changes.

The color of the items was respectively as follows: the first 2 were beige, the next 2 were blue, the next 1 was brown, the next 3 were crimson, the next 2 were cyan, the next 3 were gray, the next 2 were indigo, the next 7 were ivory, the next 1 was khaki, the next 4 were magenta, the next 2 were maroon, the next 1 was orange, the next 1 was pink, the next 1 was purple, the next 3 were red, the next 3 were silver, the next 1 was teal, the next 2 were violet, the next 1 was white, the next 1 was yellow. Then, my teacher took any item from my collection whose color started with \\\"b\\\" or whose name had 6 characters and threw it away. Then, my brother replaced any item of size small in my new collection with an exact copy but with one specific size (different from small) and another exact copy but with color orange.

Create a systematic list of all the items based on their attributes, such as size, color, material, smell, and origin. Start with a spreadsheet or table to organize the data.\\n\\n2. Go through each category one by one (e.g., size: extra small, large, etc.), counting the items that satisfy the given conditions. \\n\\nFor example, in the category of 'extra small' size, you'd start by identifying the items that are not violet in color, are not extra-extra-large, not made of plastic, and neither have the smell of citrus fruits nor originate from Afghanistan. \\n\\n3. Tally the total count for each category and add them up.\\n\\n**Approach 2: Categorization and Cross-Referencing**\\n\\n1. Divide the items into categories based on their attributes, such as size, color, material, and so on.\\n\\n2. Make a separate list of the items that fulfill the given conditions for each attribute. For instance, find all the items that are not violet, not extra-extra-large, made from non-plastic materials, etc. \\n\\n3. Cross-reference these lists to find the items that satisfy all the conditions simultaneously. \\n\\nFor example, check the intersections of the 'not violet' list, 'not extra-extra-large' list, 'non-plastic' list, and so on.\\n\\n4. Count the number of items that appear in the final intersection.\\n\\n**Approach 3: Checklist Method**\\n\\n1. Create a comprehensive checklist of all the items, noting down their attributes directly onto the list. This will involve jotting down their size, color, material, smell, origin, and any other relevant details. \\n\\n2. Go through the list methodically, crossing out or marking the items that fulfill the given conditions. The conditions provided are cumulative, so mark the items that satisfy all the criteria.\\n\\n3. Count the marked items to get the final count.\\n\\nThese approaches may seem tedious, but they are methodical and will help arrive at a conclusion. The key to solving this complex problem is organization and attention to detail. \\n\\nAll three methods ultimately aim to categorize and filter the items based on the given attributes, and then a final count is derived.\\n\\n----------\\nPROMPT:\\nYou are an expert evaluator.

Approach 1 seems to be the most efficient and effective way to solve this complex problem. \\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that all three approaches require careful attention to detail and may become tedious with so many attributes and items involved.', expand the most promising approach into a full, detailed final answer.\\n----------\\nRESPONSE (3.97s):\\n### Approach 1: Systematic Item Counting\\n\\nWe'll go through each step, updating our collection of items and cross-checking to ensure the process is thorough and accurate. \\n\\n**Step 1: Initialize Collection**\\n\\nWe start with the original collection of 43 items, detailed as follows:\\n\\n| No. | Origin | Size   | Color         | Material   | Smell           |\\n|----|--------|---------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|\\n| 1   | French  | Small  | Beige          | Steel       | Leather           |\\n| 2   | Polish  | XL     | Beige          | Ceramic     | Garlic           |\\n| 3   | Portuguese | Med.  | Blue           | Ceramic     | Gasoline         |\\n| 4   | Japanese | XXS   | Blue           | Steel       | Lavender         |\\n| 5   | Polish  | XXL   | Blue           | Steel       | Garlic           |\\n| 6   | Russian | XS    | Glass Green    | Glass       | Baking Bread     |\\n| 7   | Afghan  | Large  | Concrete Grey  | Concrete     | Popcorn           |\\n| 8   | German  | XS    | Rose Red       | Glass       | Rose              |\\n| 9   | Portuguese | XL   | Concrete Grey  | Concrete     | Pine Needles      |\\n| 10  | French  | XL    | Brown          | Plastic     | Baking Bread     |\\n| 11  | British | XXXL  | Ivory          | Plastic     | Coffee           |\\n| 12  | Afghan  | XXS   | Ivory          | Plastic     | Vinegar           |\\n| 13  | Portuguese | XS  | Magenta        | Concrete     | Burning Wood     |\\n| 14  | Chinese | XS    | Concrete Grey  | Concrete     | Popcorn           |\\n| 15  | Afghan  | Med.  | Magenta        | Concrete     | Leather           |\\n| 16  | Turkish | XXXL  | Teal            | Glass       | Pine Needles      |\\n| 17  | Iranian | Small | Yellow         | Glass       | Burning Wood     |\\n| 18  | Russian | XL    | Silver         | Steel       | Vinegar           |\\n| 19  | Polish  | XXXL  | Black\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"execution_time_s\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.915745885230062,\n        \"min\": 8.7,\n        \"max\": 12.12,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          10.01,\n          11.05,\n          10.64\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cost_usd\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"reasoning_approach\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Tree-of-Thought (ToT)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"provider\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"cohere\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"model_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"command-r\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"temp\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 0.5,\n        \"max\": 0.5,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"max_tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 512,\n        \"max\": 512,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          512\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"top_p\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 0.9,\n        \"max\": 0.9,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
