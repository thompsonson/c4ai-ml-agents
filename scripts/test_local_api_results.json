We add another object or quantity of the same type to the first one (A).\n3. The total number of objects we have now is twice what we started with, which is four.\nTherefore, when you add 2 to itself, you get 4. This is a fundamental",

    "question": "What color is the sky on a clear day?",
    "response": "The color of the sky on a clear day can vary depending on atmospheric conditions such as altitude, latitude, season, time of day, and weather phenomena like clouds or pollution. However, under normal circumstances without any significant interference from other factors, the sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. This occurs when sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere, which contains gases and tiny particles (like dust and water vapor). The shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) scatter more easily than longer wavelengths",
